## Description
#### Given initial graph, left sides of producions, right sides of productions and productions rules<br>program perform and display given sequance of productions.
## Motivation
#### Project developed for Graph Transformations and Algorithms classes AGH 2020/2021.
## Features
### Program enables following functionalities:
- reading data from .txt file (sample input given in file test.txt)
- displaying statistics about current graph: number of vertices, number of edges,<br>number of strongly connected components, average vertex degree,<br>average terminal vertex degree, average non-terminal vertex degree
- entering own sequence of productions to perform
- choosing one production to perform from a list
- animation of performing a sequance of graph transfromations
## Technologies
#### Python 3.8 + networkx + matplotlib + PyQt5
## Usage
#### To start run main.py with data filename as argument
